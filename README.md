# Astrophysics- A custom software made for an old collaborator.  The software extracts from a given range the date and time when two or more planets have close azimuth and close altitude/elevation for a given location.  The software is only partially realized, missing the extraction of the negative and positive altitude with the same balance value.  To explain a little fancifully but for everyone to understand, "this program creates something similar to a shadow cone during an eclipse reflected on a certain location".  The program can be used as a tool to help Lagrange variations and celestial intersections.
